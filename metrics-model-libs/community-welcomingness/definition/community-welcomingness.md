# Community Welcomingness

# Why It Matters
It is important to ensure that your community is welcoming to newcomers as well as long-time community members. Creating a welcoming environment can help in empowering community members to commit time and effort to your project. 

# User Stories
- As a newcomer, I am curious as to whether I will be welcome in a new community or not. 
- As a member from an organization interested in an open source project, I would like to know if my employees will be able to contribute to the project on behalf of the organization. 
- As a maintainer, I would like to know how many potential new contributors I am losing because my project is not as welcoming as it could be. 
- As an organization who runs open source projects, I want to know if my project is open to including new contributors for the sustainability of my project.
